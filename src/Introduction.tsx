      <p>Hi! 👋 I'm Cariad!</p>
      <p>I'm a full stack engineer looking for contract / permanent roles.</p>
      <p>
        I have commercial experience in startups and global multinationals, in
        financial and medical technologies, with Python and C#. I'm passionate
        about test-driven development, DevOps cultures and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an experienced AWS engineer, Meta-certified frontend developer and
        IBM-certified AI developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live by the sea in Exmouth, UK, so I'm looking for in-office roles in
        the Exeter area or remote roles from anywhere. I'm happy to negotiate
        travel and longer commutes.
