        I have commercial experience in both startups and global multinationals,

        DevOps cultures and security.

        I'm a Meta-certified frontend developer, and an IBM-certified AI
        developer.

      <p>
        And I live by the sea in Exmouth, UK, so I'm looking for in-office roles
        in the Exeter area or remote roles from anywhere.
